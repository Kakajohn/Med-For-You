`This is my thesis for Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, dpt: Informatics`

## Tech Stack

**Client:** `JSX REACT REDUX SCSS JS`

**Server:** `MongoDB Express Websockets`

## How to run the project

| cd frontend | cd backend | cd ..       |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| npm i       | npm i      | npm run dev |

| cd socket | socket         |
| --------- | -------------- |
| npm i     | npm run socket |

### Prepare the database

The project uses MongoDB Compass. You are gonna have to download the app. After the set up is done you need to
follow this sequence : open the app then select **Fill in connection fields individually** and **connect**.

## About the project

The website contains 3 pages. The two of them are for the patients or anyone who wants to read
about **F.A.P.** and **Crohn**, (the articles that exist in the site are provided after consultation
with the doctor _George Loufopoulos_). The third and main page for my thesis is the **Chat room**.

The projects purpose is to give a change to people with autoimmune diseases to find each other,
chat, share their experience. This is the main purpose of the website. So i created a live chat room
for those patients.

You will shortly find out that is mostly **backend** with a simple **clientside** as with this project i was starting my journey
as a developer and i was searching what skills suits me best.

## TO DO / FIX

//FIXME: fix responsiveness for mobile and tablet.

//FIXME: use Context or config.json files for all the texts.

//TODO: Check the database.
