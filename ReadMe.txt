## About the project

The website contains 3 pages. The two of them are for the patients or anyone who wants to read
about **F.A.P.** and **Crohn**, (the articles that exist in the site are provided after consultation
with the doctor George Loufopoulos). The third and main page for my thesis is the **Chat room**.

The projects purpose is to give a change to people with autoimmune diseases to find each other,
chat, share their experience. This is the main purpose of the website. So i created a live chat room
for those patients.

You will shortly find out that is mostly **backend** as with this project i was starting my journey
as a developer and i was searching what skills suits me best.
